And used nginx to proxy pass the CORS with live preview since Im little lazy: \

```
server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  local.ixshel.com;

        # ng serve config
        location / {

            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4200;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;

            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   html;
        }
    }
```

To run it you just need to set your nginx similar to what I did and then run ```npm run start``` I modified the script to run without the host check
